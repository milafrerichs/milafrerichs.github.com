I’m using vim and tux and constantly learn new tricks and new shortcuts.
I have a post-it note with new stuff I want to learn and still need to look up. Once they become second nature, I create a new post-it, and move on to the next shortcuts.

I wanted to write a quick review of lasts year&rsquo;s conferences.
I got accepted to speak at the following conferences in 2019
 FOSS4G NA, San Diego GoodTechFest, Chicago NACIS, Tacoma FOSS4G Oceania, Auckland  The three talks that I gave at these conferences were:</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-dark no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/speaking-review-2019/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/css-trick-show-a-fallback/">CSS Trick: Show a fallback</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base leading-normal mt-2">I was working on the Mapping with d3 site when I thought about an opt-in field with RightMessage (RM).
When I have an offer for a visitor RM will show something, but when I don&rsquo;t have anything I want to show a fallback that I don&rsquo;t want to create with RM.
So I thought I can just leave it inside the box that RM would fill with content. But even if they don&rsquo;t have an offer they will overwrite the box.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-dark no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/css-trick-show-a-fallback/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/speaking-at-conferences/">Speaking at conferences</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base leading-normal mt-2">I&rsquo;m an introvert.

Recently I read a lot of articles on the topic of blogging and how the blogs killed the old internet of curating content. We went from curating our experience on the Web to just push out content.

Although I read more than the year before.
One of the reasons why I did not read as many books were that I decided not to listen to audiobooks while in the forest with ruby.

I thought this visualization could be improved to bring the point across more clearly.
A slope chart would be a great option.
 A slope graph can be used to show a ‘before and after’ story of different values, based on comparing their values at different points in time.

Conferences are a good way to connect with people, learn more about your craft or other people&rsquo;s business and get in the mindset of learning and speaking/socializing.
Brennan Dunn recently tweeted something which struck a nerve with me, and I regretted not going to DYFC in Sweden this year. But I will go to more conferences next year and a few more business conferences as well, and DYFC 2017 is already on my calendar.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-dark no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-20-conferences/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-19-habits/">Three new habits to get better at writing</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base leading-normal mt-2">I want to start a few habits and it’s tough to find the right ones to start and to maintain.
Getting into habits is all about consistency and trying to find the balance of too little or too much. But I think publicly committing to something is a good first step to getting really into habits.
I tried for the last months to get into reading and writing habit. And I must admit both are not doing great.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-dark no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-19-habits/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2014-01-31-nokogiri-helper/">Nokogiri Search Helper</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base leading-normal mt-2">I recently used Scraperwiki to scrape some data off a couple of sites.
During the development process (which I will describe in a coming post) I encountered some repetitive code/task. I then refactored the code and wrote a small class which I then would use for every site.
Most often you want the first text of the matching selector and the attr of the first element matching.
You can find the class here: {% gist 8491837%}</p></div></div></div></main><footer class="font-sans md:py-8 px-4"><div class="mx-auto container overflow-hidden flex flex-col justify-between text-center"><div class="w-full flex-grow md:flex md:items-center md:w-auto"><div class="text-sm md:flex-grow"><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/me/">About me</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/hire-me/">Hire me!</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/talks-workshops/">Speaking</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/writing/">Writing</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/now/">Now</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/themes/">Themes</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/data-visualizations/">Data Visualization</a><a class="block mt-4 md:inline-block md:mt-0 text-grey-darker hover:text-grey-dark mr-4 no-underline" href="/projects/">Work</a></div></div><ul class="text-grey-dark list-reset font-thin flex text-center justify-center text-2xl py-2 flex-col"><li class="pt-2">☕️🐕❄️☀️</li><li class="pt-2">🥃</li><li class="pt-2">⚾️🏈🏄‍♂️🏊‍♂️🏂🧗‍♀️</li><li class="pt-2">🍣🍔🌮🌯🍕</li><li class="pt-2">🗺🏔🏟✈️🚍🚃</li></ul><div class="text-grey-dark font-thin flex text-center justify-center text-2xl py-2"><a class="items-center text-white hover:text-grey mr-3 no-underline" rel="me" href="https://github.com/milafrerichs"><svg class="w-5" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>GitHub icon</title><path d="M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385.6.113.82-.258.82-.577 0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729 1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236 1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93 0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176 0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405 1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405 2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22 0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22 0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286 0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12"/></svg>
