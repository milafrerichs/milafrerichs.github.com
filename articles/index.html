When I have an offer for a visitor RM will show something, but when I don&rsquo;t have anything I want to show a fallback that I don&rsquo;t want to create with RM.
So I thought I can just leave it inside the box that RM would fill with content. But even if they don&rsquo;t have an offer they will overwrite the box.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/css-trick-show-a-fallback/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/speaking-at-conferences/">Speaking at conferences</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I&rsquo;m an introvert. But I love conferences. I love sharing what I know.
I love being on the stage and talking about what I have learned and what I&rsquo;m passionate about. I am nervous, and I always forget a little bit of what I want to say but I still love it.
I hate being at conferences on my own but it&rsquo;s the best way to make new connections.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/speaking-at-conferences/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/working-with-forestry-and-hugo/">Working with forestry and hugo</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">When I decided to start a new blog I thought about which platform I want to use.
Here is what I wanted from the potential platform
 Static site generator Gh Pages Ability to have an easy way to create posts Have a Frontend for just the posts Ability to write in markdown Not using html directly but use something smaller/smarter (the main reason I used middleman) like HAML Ability to use data files Clean default themes  Both Jekyll and Hugo offered most of the important things.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/working-with-forestry-and-hugo/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/digital-gardening/">Digital Gardening</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">Instead of creating a stream of blog posts, I will transform my personal site and the Mapping with d3 site to a garden that I take care of, maintain, and grow.
Recently I read a lot of articles on the topic of blogging and how the blogs killed the old internet of curating content. We went from curating our experience on the Web to just push out content. Without caring that much how they all fit together.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/digital-gardening/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/habits-habit-tracking/">Habits &amp; Habit Tracking</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">After I read Atomic Habits last year I wanted to get better with my habits.
I made it a 12-week year goal (blog post about that coming as well). And sorta got better at it … But I fell off.
I attended a workshop of Stefanie Posavec and in her book Observe, Collect, Draw! : A Visual Journal there is a cool way of visualizing your habits.
I started but eventually fell off the track as well.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/habits-habit-tracking/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/books-that-i-read-in-2019/">Books that I read in 2019.</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I wanted to read 15 books last year, and I did not even come close :(
Although I read more than the year before.
One of the reasons why I did not read as many books were that I decided not to listen to audiobooks while in the forest with ruby. I wanted to enjoy the silence and solitude of the forest and be in the moment and not distract myself.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/books-that-i-read-in-2019/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/categories-of-podcasts-i-listen-to/"> Categories of Podcasts I listen to</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I listen to a lot of podcasts these days and have a huge backlog of episodes I want to listen to.
I usually do this on car trips. The last time from my drive back from Italy to Berlin. A 12h trip that resulted in a lot of listend listened to episodes :)
And earlier during my retreat in Washington State driving to and from Mt. Rainier.
On a daily basis, I listen to podcasts while walking my dog, while driving to the forest and when cleaning :)</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/categories-of-podcasts-i-listen-to/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/twitter-diet/">Twitter diet</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">‪I need to reduce the daily amount of tweets I see in my timeline and be more proactive about when I open twitter.‬ I spend too much time on twitter scrolling through my timeline and not reading actively.

I recently read these couple of articles about blog posts and content on the internet.
 My blog is a digital garden, not a blog How the Blog Broke the Web MORE STUFF OR BETTER STUFF?

It always is sad to leave my small family (wife and dog) but I love traveling around the world.

Since the article did not include San Diego, I thought I can do it.
Residential land zone for detached single-family &nbsp; other housing

As you can see, there are more single-family zones, than other residential areas.

For example, I will add details about the country or city the conference is in. Adding pictures of the town, or in case of my workshops use data from that city to use as examples or exercises for the participants. Thinking about who is in the audience helps them to relate more to my talk/workshop and hopefully pay closer attention.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/vizrisk-challenge-audience/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/makeover-monday-how-americans-sleep/">Makeover Monday: How Americans Sleep</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">Practicing your skills is essential in every aspect of your life, primarily when you work for yourself. When I coach my softball team, I always work on the basics. We hit a lot, and we field a lot. The same is true for my work, and since I have the fortune to work for myself and make my own schedule, I always like to practice my skills.
One goal for me for this year is to share more stuff openly and not just work on my skills in private.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/makeover-monday-how-americans-sleep/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/vizrisk-challenge-entry/">VizRisk Challenge Entry</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I love playing Softball and I‘m playing for more than 10 years now, it is a great team sport and I love the mix of action, team play and personal challenge getting up 1 vs. 1 against the pitcher. I used to coach the women&rsquo;s team of the town that I studied in and was asked again to coach my team here in Berlin.

I started with technical podcasts like Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots, Ruby Rogues, Core Intuition and more. I think I have an easier time listening to something than to read a blog post. I can listen to them while walking my dog, riding my bike to college back in the days or taking the train.
Since starting my own business in 2014, I listen to more and more business and freelance related podcasts.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-08-02-five-podcastss/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/2016-08-01-two-years/">Two-year anniversary</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">Wow, I can’t believe it! It’s been two years already. I did it! :)
Today I’m in business for two years with my company Civic Vision. I founded the company on Aug. 2014 and am happy to report that we’re still operating and growing every year.
Our revenue grew every year and our profit as well.
I had the opportunity to work with awesome companies and organizations such as Code for America, Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, Worldbank, 18f, Terranodo.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-08-01-two-years/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/2016-07-28-podcasts/">Podcasts I listen to regularly</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I listen to podcast for a while now.

After my last trip staying at a friends place for a week, my emails started to pile up, and my filters were not any good anymore.
So I used the last two days to clean up my inbox and add more and better filters to my inboxes.
I started with my personal account because it&rsquo;s easier to clean up.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-27-inbox-zero/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/2016-07-26-mapswipe/">Help families in need: MapSwipe</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">A new app launched a little more than a week ago called MapSwipe.

And I thought about Data Sets where I could reuse/redeploy apps from other cities. There are 44 datasets in the current portal, and I wanted to use something that could be done relatively quickly but still would be an improvement.
Finding the right dataset After looking through several datasets and trying to find apps that I could easily reuse and redeploy I found the „Monitoring of select chemical parameters in drinking water“ dataset and I remembered an app from Code for Heilbronn, Germany about drinking water quality.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-25-drinking-water/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/2016-07-21-activities/">How I keep myself healthy and inspired while working for myself</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">Working for yourself can get lonely and monotone.

Activities I love doing sports. I’m a very active and sport-hungry person. And I love team-sports. I play Softball for almost ten years now, and I love going to tournaments, compete and have fun with friends. I met my wife through Softball, and I’m very grateful for that.

Conferences are a good way to connect with people, learn more about your craft or other people&rsquo;s business and get in the mindset of learning and speaking/socializing.
Brennan Dunn recently tweeted something which struck a nerve with me, and I regretted not going to DYFC in Sweden this year. But I will go to more conferences next year and a few more business conferences as well, and DYFC 2017 is already on my calendar.</p><a class="block mt-2 font-normal text-base text-grey-darkest no-underline hover:underline" href="/articles/2016-07-20-conferences/">Read More</a></div><div class="mb-16"><a class="block mb-1 text-lg text-black font-bold no-underline hover:underline" href="http://milafrerichs.de/articles/2016-07-19-habits/">Three new habits to get better at writing</a><p class="text-grey-darkest text-base">I want to start a few habits and it’s tough to find the right ones to start and to maintain.
Getting into habits is all about consistency and trying to find the balance of too little or too much. But I think publicly committing to something is a good first step to getting really into habits.
I tried for the last months to get into reading and writing habit.
