      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Mila Frerichs. I love to help advocacy groups and non-profits make cities and the world a better place. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love what I do and would not exchange it for a regular job.
I use my software development skills to do good and help others. I am fortunate that I can use my passion to make a living.
I love what I do and if I would not have founded my own company Civic Vision in 2014, I would volunteer my time to do good.</description>

      <description>Instead of goals I adapted an approach by Brian Casel using themes.
I think this is more aligned with my thinking and lifestyle.Here are my themes as of February 2019.
Travel to at least two new cities/regions I want to explore more of the world.
Last year I managed to visit 4 continents. Only one is left: Antartica
This can be challenging but I want to make it someday.</description>
