<h1 id="i-help-civic-advocacy-groups-and-governments-improve-the-life-of-citizens-with-the-help-of-open-data">I help civic advocacy groups and governments improve the life of citizens with the help of Open Data.</h1>

<p>Governmentes publish Open Data for everyone to use free of charge to increase transparency and help make better decisions with the availble data.</p>

<p>Non-profits can use this treasure to keep the government accountable and improve the life of citizens.</p>

<h2 id="i-help-non-profits-find-the-right-data-and-create-tools-dashboards-and-visulizations-to-increase-their-success">I help non-profits find the right data and create <strong>tools, dashboards and visulizations</strong> to increase their success.</h2>

<h3 id="hi-i-m-mila-frerichs">Hi, I&rsquo;m <strong>Mila Frerichs.</strong></h3>

<p>I love to help advocacy groups and non-profits make cities and the world a better place. That&rsquo;s why <strong>I love what I do</strong> and would not exchange it for a regular job.</p>

<p>I use my software development skills to do good and help others. I am fortunate that I can use my <strong>passion</strong> to make a living.<br />
I love what I do and if I would not have founded my own company <a href="https://civicvision.de">Civic Vision</a> in 2014, I would volunteer my time to do good.</p>

<p>I like to give <a href="/talks">talks</a> at (geospatial) conferences and share mostly stuff that I encounter in my work. I gave a lot of <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> in d3 because that is my preferred library to create visualizations.</p>

<p>I live with my wife and our dog in a nice flat in the heart of <strong>Berlin-West</strong>.<br />
I was born in Berlin but moved to a small town MÃ¼nster where I studied Geoinformatics and met my wife. I played a lot of Softball during my university time and always worked on the side.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://twitter.com/milafrerichs">@milafrerichs</a> on twitter and almost everywhere :)</p>

<p>I write about Civic Tech, Open Data, mapping and vizualizations over at <a href="http://civicopendata.com">Civic Open Data</a>.</p>
