I got back into online gaming. The process was slow but got accelerated by the pandemic.

First, it was with a friend whom I used to play at his place. We just played party games with his new girlfriend.  
Even before the pandemic, we wanted to play more together (because his girlfriend lives in another city). I set up everything, and then the pandemic hit, and now we played a couple of more times.

And now, I even played a strategic game online ([Northgard](https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/)) with my cousin.

And it was a lot of fun. I even missed my usual bedtime because I had so much fun. I went to bed at 12:30 which is way later than usual :)
