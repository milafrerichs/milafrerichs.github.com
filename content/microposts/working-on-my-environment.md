It was time to work on my environment again.

After streamlining the theme for vim across my devices (for some reason I still had solarized dark on my MacBook instead of solarized light), I decided itâ€˜s time to look at other font options.

After researching a little bit, sitting on it for a few days, trying out a few options, I finally settled on [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

It has ligatures and I must say, I did not think I would appreciate them as much as I do.

You should try it out.
