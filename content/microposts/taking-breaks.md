I (try to) use the [Pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) as often as possible.

I have an app for my watch to start a 25-minute focus session.

And the goal is to focus for 25 minutes on a task and then take a short 5-minute break. 

I always get more done when I use that technique. The break is the reward for the focus work. As far as I am concerned :) I don't fall into the trap of distracting myself too much when I use the Pomodoro technique. 

But I sometimes just forget to use it. Especially when Iâ€™m not sure what to work on. But this should be the time to use it and it's a reminder for myself to better plan my day.
