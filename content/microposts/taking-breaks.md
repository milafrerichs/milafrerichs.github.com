I (try to ) use the Pomodoro technique as often as possible.

I have an app for my watch to start a 25-minute focus session. 

And the goal is to focus for 25 minutes on a task and then take a short 5-minute break. 

I always get more done when I use that technique. But I sometimes just forget to use it. 

Especially when Iâ€™m not sure what to work on, or know exactly what to work on (only have one task that I want to get done that day, especially client work).
