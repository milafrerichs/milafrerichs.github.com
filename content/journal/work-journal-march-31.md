I want to share more what I do every day so I started this journal after inspiration from [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/journal/). Love what the guy is doing, so I will do something similar.

This week started off very well with the public launch of the waiting list for my upcoming Online Workshop about ["Geospatial Data Visualization with d3"](https://civic.vision/geospatial-data-visualization-with-d3/).

And I'm very happy with the result. This encourages me to start on this rather sooner than later and is kind of a bummer that I did not do this earlier. :)

# What I was exited about

The launch of the waiting list for the [online video course "Geospatial Data Visualization with d3"](https://civic.vision/geospatial-data-visualization-with-d3/). And I'm excited about [FOSS4G](2019.foss4g-na.org) in my favorite American city: San Diego.

And naturally the start of the Baseball Season! Let's go Padres, let's go!

# What I'm excited about next week

To get in touch with the people interested in my online workshop and spread the word about it even more.

# Problem(s) I solved this week

### Cloudinary "responsive" images.

I use cloudinary after Adam mentioned it in his podcast (Full Stack Radio). And I love it. It's great and fast! But I wanted to use more of the power of cloudinary so I decided to look even further. Delivering the right image for everyone. Read this [blog post](https://cloudinary.com/blog/responsive_images_with_srcset_sizes_and_cloudinary)and look at my [PR](https://github.com/CivicVision/civicopendata/pull/27)how I implemented it.

### ConvertKit subscriber email in RM

It took some time and a few messages with support to figure this out, but this is how you can use the subscribers email address in Rightmessage personalization
