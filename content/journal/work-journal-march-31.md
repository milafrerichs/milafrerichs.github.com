I want to share more what I do every day, so I'm starting this (weekly) journal after inspiration from [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/journal/). Love what the guy is doing so I will do something similar.


## Waiting list for my upcoming online-course
This week started off very well with the public launch of the waiting list for my upcoming Online Workshop about ["Geospatial Data Visualization with d3"](https://civic.vision/geospatial-data-visualization-with-d3/).
I'm excited about the launch of the waiting list for my first product.  
On Sunday last week I tweeted about it and it was a huge success for me.  
I'm thrilled with the result and response that I got. This encourages me to start on this rather sooner than later and is kind of a bummer that I did not do this earlier. :)

## FOSS4G NA in San Diego
And I'm excited about [FOSS4G](2019.foss4g-na.org) in my favorite American city: __San Diego.__  
In just two weeks I will be travelling to San Diego and give a workshop and a talk at FOSS4G NA. I'm trying to write a post before the conference to tell you more about where to eat, what to do in San Diego.  
My workshop will be about the same topic as my new online workshop: ["Geospatial Data Visualization with d3"](https://civic.vision/geospatial-data-visualization-with-d3/).

## Baseball is back!
I'm excited about the start of the Baseball Season! Now I can relax my evenings with watching Baseball.  
My wife is not so thrilled because I will now spend a good amount of my time talking about Baseball and watching Baseball games.  

Let's go, Padres, let's go!

## Problem(s) I solved this week

### Cloudinary "responsive" images.
I use cloudinary after Adam mentioned it in his podcast (Full Stack Radio). And I love it. It's excellent and fast! But I wanted to use more of the power of cloudinary, so I decided to look even further. Delivering the right image for everyone. Read this [blog post](https://cloudinary.com/blog/responsive_images_with_srcset_sizes_and_cloudinary) and look at my [PR](https://github.com/CivicVision/civicopendata/pull/27) how I implemented it.

### ConvertKit subscriber email in RM
It took some time and a few messages with support to figure this out, but this is how you can use the subscriber's email address in [RightMessage](https://rightmessage.com) personalization
```
    {{convertkit.email}}
```

## What's next
- __Talking to people on my waiting list__: I will reach out to the people on my wating list, sharing the content of the course and get to know them better. So I can better serve them with this course.
- __Promoting my workshop__: I will continoue to tweet and write about the upcoming course!
