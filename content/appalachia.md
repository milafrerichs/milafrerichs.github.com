Hello 100 days in Appalachia - Team,

My name is Mila, and I'm a Data Visualization and Open Data Consultant, and I would like to help you with my skills.  

I work to do good, that's why I work mostly with nonprofits and foundations like the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and Code for America. 

I studied Geoinformatics at the University of Muenster, Germany, which I did not finish with a degree but instead founded my own company.

I love diving into data and creating reports, visualizations and analysis from datasets. I volunteered with Code for America and Code for Germany because I’m especially interested in Civic Tech and made my hobby my profession.

I gave several talks on Geospatial Analysis pipelines with Jupyter and observable notebooks. I gave workshops at FOSS4G conferences on „Geospatial Data Visualizations with d3“ and started publishing at [mappingwithd3.com](https://mappingwithd3.com)

__Quick selection of my skills you might find useful:__

* Data Analysis with R, python and node.js
* Data Visualization & Maps with d3.js, vega and R
* Data Exploration with Observable & Jupyter notebooks
* Webapplication Development with React, Svelte
* Maps with OpenLayers, Leaflet, Mapbox GL.js
