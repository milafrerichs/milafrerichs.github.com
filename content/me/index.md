### Hi, I'm __Mila Frerichs.__

I love to help advocacy groups and non-profits make cities and the world a better place. That's why __I love what I do__ and would not exchange it for a regular job.

I use my software development skills to do good and help others. I am fortunate that I can use my __passion__ to make a living.  
I love what I do and if I would not have founded my own company [Civic Vision](https://civicvision.de) in 2014, I would volunteer my time to do good.

I like to give [talks](/talks-workshops) at (geospatial) conferences and share mostly stuff that I encounter in my work. I gave a lot of [workshops](/talks-workshops) in d3 because that is my preferred library to create visualizations.

I live with my wife and our dog in a nice flat in the heart of __Berlin-West__.   
I was born in Berlin but moved to a small town MÃ¼nster where I studied Geoinformatics and met my wife. I played a lot of Softball during my university time and always worked on the side.

I'm [@milafrerichs](https://twitter.com/milafrerichs) on twitter and almost everywhere :) 

I write about Civic Tech, Open Data, mapping and vizualizations on my [blog](/articles) and about mapping with d3 at [Mapping with d3](https://mappingwithd3.com)

### I love to travel

I love to travel and explore the world. Below is a scratchmap of places I've been to colored in green.
