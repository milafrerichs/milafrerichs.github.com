Hello Stamen Team,

My name is Mila, and I'm a Data Visualization and Open Data Consultant.

I studied Geoinformatics at the University of Muenster, Germany, which I did not finish with a degree but instead founded my own company.

I worked professionally with nonprofits like the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and Code for America. 

I also worked on a lot of geospatial projects. I worked with Boundless(Geo) on MapLoom, with Terranodo and Novel-T on a new react-based webclient for GeoNode. Moreover, I have worked indirectly on a visualization dashboard for the Nepal Earthquakes for the GFDRR Team of the Worldbank.   
My last geospatial project end of last year and earlier this year was with a Munich-based startup improving and extending their prototype using Aermod dispersion models to model air quality data with the help of satellite data.  

I love diving into data and creating reports and analysis from datasets. I volunteered with Code for America and Code for Germany because I’m especially interested in Civic Tech.

I give workshops at FOSS4G conference on „Geospatial Data Visualizations with d3“ and publish at [mappingwithd3.com](https://mappingwithd3.com)

And a quick rundown of my skills you might need:

Would love to work with such a well-known company as stamen!
