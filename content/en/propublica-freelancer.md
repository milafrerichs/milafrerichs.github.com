Hello ProPublica Team,

My name is Mila, and I'm a Data Visualization and Open Data Consultant.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/575771062" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As I said in the video (have you watched it yet? üòÅ, I would love to be part of the ProPublica family as a freelancer.

I'm Mila, I am a civic hacker who turned his passion into his profession seven years ago. And ever since I've worked in the civic tech sector, helping advocacy groups, foundations and governments improve the life of citizens.

I helped organisations like Code for America, Open Knowledge Foundation, Technology Foundation Berlin and Bertelsmann Foundation create tools and visualisation around civic tech and open data.

Civic Tech and DDJ have a lot of overlap that‚Äôs why I am applying. I see a lot of great projects coming out of newsrooms and of course from you, that are similar to the projects we tackle as civic hackers.

I would love to dive into the journalism aspect a little more and learn more about how newsrooms work and create their projects.

I follow a lot of (data) journalists on twitter and love seeing their discussions and projects. I am in the NICAR Slack and on the NICAR mailing list as well¬†üòÅ

These are the three projects I like to highlight:

### Vision Zero Dashboard San Diego

Vision Zero is a topic more and more cities are taking seriously and is dear to my heart. The challenge is to communicate the severity of the problem.

With this project I tried to start with a human connection.I wanted to show where the collisions happened and how many lives were lost already this year.

Inspired by the Vision Zero Map from the city of LA I started by creating a few visualizations based on an Open Data dataset from the City of San Diego. I was limited to the data available from the city and was fortunate enough that collision data was available. After the initial data analysis and creating a prototype I presented this project to the advocacy group Circulate San Diego whip helped me with the wording on the site.

* data pipeline runs daily on AWS as lambdas
* geocding via GoogleMaps geocoder
* googlemaps heatmap
* visualisations in d3.js

I‚Äôm particularly proud that the system is still running and I only needed to change a few small things over the years, mostly when the city changed the data format and location of the data files.

All parts of the project is, as most of my projects are, open source and can be found here:

### Code Enforcement Violations San Diego

The project Code Enforcement violations came out of discussions I saw on twitter and in San Diego newspapers back in 2016. Reported Code Violations weren‚Äôt closed for a long period of time and I wanted to see if the data supported the claims.

Luckily the City of San Diego did publish Code Enforcement Violations as Open Data on their Open Data Portal. So I dove into the data and tried to find evidence for the claims.

### Wazimap NG

I was hired to be the team lead for the Open Source mapping application Wazimap from September 2020 until June 2021. I was responsible for three to five developers (mostly contractors).

My main responsibility was to be the connection between the contractors (hired via upwork) and the organization behind Wazimap OpenUp. We planned the upcoming work and created issues and assigned work to the contractors.

I reviewed the work of the contractor via GitHub PRs and provided feedback and testing to the contractors and organisation.

I also was responsible for creating small parts of the code base if needed. For example, did I replace the existing home-grown charting ‚Äûlibrary‚Äú with Vega to make it easier to create other types of visualisations and add more filters.
