Hello ProPublica Team,

My name is Mila, and I'm a Data Visualization and Open Data Consultant.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/575771062" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I studied Geoinformatics at the University of Muenster, Germany, which I did not finish with a degree but instead founded my own company.

I worked professionally with nonprofits like the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and Code for America.

I love diving into data and creating reports and analysis from datasets. I volunteered with Code for America and Code for Germany because I’m especially interested in Civic Tech.

These are the three projects I like to highlight:

### Vision Zero Dashboard San Diego

### Code Enforcement Violations San Diego

### Wazimap NG

I give workshops at FOSS4G conference on „Geospatial Data Visualizations with d3“ and published at [mappingwithd3.com](https://mappingwithd3.com)
