I want to go back into politics. It is the right time to do so. On the federal level there is a potentially change in leadership coming. The parliament is younger than ever and in Berlin there is change coming too.

So Iâ€˜m really tempted to go back, I always was political but only in my younger age (high school and college) was I active in a political party. 

As a business owner it is a bit more challenging. Or at least that is what I tell myself. 

But it is also way more expensive to be in a political party as a business owner. 

I will try to get involved without joining a party yet and need to decide how much I want to get involved.

I have strong beliefs and I used to be more open about it. If you look at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/milafrerichs) history you would see :)
