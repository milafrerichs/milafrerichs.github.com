I want to share more, but I also want to show my process and my progress. It's hard to create full fledged blog posts with a lot of research and content.  

I have around 40 half-baked articles that I have not finished and even more ideas about topics.  

I want to use this digital garden to share my in-between stuff. My research, my not fully-fledged out thoughts and notes.  

I want to share [[tools]] and things I do and did in the past to help myself and my clients be more productive.  

I've never found a good place for them, but I think this garden could be it.
