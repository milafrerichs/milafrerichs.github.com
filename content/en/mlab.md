Hello M-Lab - Team,

My name is Mila, and I'm a Data Visualization and Open Data Consultant, and I would like to help you with my skills.  

Your mission of providing free and open data internet measurement data is very much aligned with my mission of using my skills to make Open Data more usable for the general public and governments itself. That's why I work mostly with nonprofits and foundations like the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and Code for America. 

Your approach to this project, going from prototype to then transform it into a well-tested and documented project, is well-thought-out and fits with my skills and my own approach.  
I love testing and helped [streetmix](https://streetmix.net) improve the testing with their react-based civic tech project.  

For the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, I helped create a master data catalog for Open Data in Germany. We went from a small prototype to a catalog for one state in Germany. And the next phase is a complete rollout for Germany.  

A little bit about myself and my background:  
I studied Geoinformatics at the University of Muenster, Germany, which I did not finish with a degree but instead founded my own company.

I love diving into data and creating reports, visualizations, and projects from open data. I volunteered with Code for America and Code for Germany because I’m especially interested in Civic Tech and made my hobby my profession.

I gave workshops at FOSS4G conferences on „Geospatial Data Visualizations with d3“ and started publishing at [mappingwithd3.com](https://mappingwithd3.com)

__Quick selection of my skills you might find useful:__
