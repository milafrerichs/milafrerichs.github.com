I love to travel and visit the world. 

I can proudly say that I visited every continent except Antarctica. 

There are regions that I have not visited (south America as the biggest. )

But here is a scratch map of my travels

I love to travel to cities. I like the vibe of cities much better than jus termite touristy areas. 

I traveled a lot by myself in the early days and the recent years due to my conference travels. 

The trips I was most excited about:

\- Singapore (with my wife)

\- Yosemite national park and SoCal (with my wife)

\- Vancouver (island) (with my wife)

\- Australia (Melbourne)

\- Zanzibar/Tanzania
