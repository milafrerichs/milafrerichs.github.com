I got [back into playing video games](https://milafrerichs.com/microposts/back-into-online-gaming/) and especially online games but itâ€™s a trap as well.

I already played more during the day than I usually do. Which is a bad habit. I think I need to restrict myself more. Although I used a timer to limit my daytime playing to 10-20 minutes. I just play too much.
