Here is a list of projects that I have worked on or am still working on. This is not an extensive list of projects I have been working on. My GitHub page has a lot more to offer :) 

# Geospatial Data Visualization with d3

My latest product I'm working on currently. I gave several workshops over the years and conferences around the world on how to use d3 for your mapping project. The demand was high over the last years so I decided I want to turn this into an online course so I can help more people and make it more accessible. 

I presold the course to a couple of people last month and am currently building out the material. 

# GeoNode Map Viewer/Editor

For the popular geospatial content management system Geonode I developed a React-based viewer/editor for a client and open sources it. It became the new default client for GeoNode back in 2017. You can find the code here.

# Open data city census

I was lucky enough to get funding from the prototypefund to work on a civic tech prototype. The Open Data City Census is an effort to automatically rank each Open Data portal of german cities. 

# Infrastructure San Diego

Back in 2016 I worked with the council committee on Infrastructure ... for the City of San Diego to improve transparency and information regarding Capital Improvement Projects and the involvement of local Community Planning Groups. 

# Mapbox for R
