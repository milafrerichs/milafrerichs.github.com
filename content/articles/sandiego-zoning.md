## Single family homes in San Diego

Inspired by this article from the New York Times I wanted to create the same map for San Diego. Since the article did not include San Diego I thought I can do it. 


As you can see, more single family zones than other residential areas. I expected that but there is a lot of space that is blank. Need to figure out what zone that is. 


# Methodology
I used data from the city od San Diego about the zones, matched the zones from the municipal code and Building data from Microsoft. 
I matched those buildings up with the zone theyâ€™re in and colored according to the code. 
Everything that starts with RS is (color) and is labeled in the municipal code as 
And every other Rx is blue.
