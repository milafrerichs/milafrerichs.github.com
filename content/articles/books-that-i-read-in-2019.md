I wanted to read 15 books last year, and I did not even come close :( 

Although I read more than the year before.

One of the reasons why I did not read as many books were that I decided not to listen to audiobooks while in the forest with ruby. I wanted to enjoy the silence and solitude of the forest and be in the moment and not distract myself. 

That resulted in fewer books read. 

So in 2020, I want to read every day at least one page in the morning. Let‘s see how that goes :) 

Books I read

* Hyperfocus
* Deep work
* The one thing
* Atomic Habit
* Flawless Consulting
* Indistractable

You guessed right that I‘m somewhat obsessed with productivity, deep work and habits last year. And still am, it changed how I approach my day-to-day work.
