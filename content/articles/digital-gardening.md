Instead of creating a stream of blog posts I will transform my personal site and the [Mapping with d3](https://mappingwithd3.com) site to a garden that I take care off, maintain and grow.

Recently I read a lot of articles on the topic of blogging and how the [blogs killed the old internet ](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)of curating content. We went from curating our experience on the Web to just push out content. Without caring that much how they all fit together.

I am guilty myself I just published articles and although a few of them are very old they still are important and people might be interested in them.

## What does a garden look like?

I will take the effort over the next couple of months to show you my most relevant content first and not my latest thoughts.

I will rearrange my „blog“ from a stream of content sorted by publish date to a curated list of content items that I want you to read. You will still able to access my content as a stream and if you subscribe to my email list you will get this stream as well :)

I think this will benefit all of us. I'm not under pressure to produce the greatest and lengthy content all the time and you get the benefit of my important thoughts :)
