I love sharing what I know. And sharing at a conference and especially giving a workshop is very satisfying. The feedback you get and the conversation you have afterward are great.

I cannot encourage everyone enough to try it out.   
Don't get discouraged by rejections, **everyone gets rejected**. I know a very good and frequent speaker and his proposals to a big conference get rejected all the time.  

Do you know the Global Diversity CFP day?  
If not check them out, they offer workshops on how to apply to speak at conferences around the world.

Last year my proposals got accepted at three conferences and I had to bail out from speaking at FOSS4G Oceania this year. I had too much work to do and too little budget to make the trip this year. But I will apply again next year.
