I listen to a lot of podcasts these days and have a huge backlog of episodes I want to listen to. 

I usually do this on car trips. The last time from my drive back from Italy to Berlin. A 12h trip that resulted in a lot of listend listened to episodes :)

And earlier during my retreat in Washington State driving to and from Mt. Rainier.

On a daily basis, I listen to podcasts while walking my dog, while driving to the forest and when cleaning :)

I have a few categories of podcasts I listen to and I will write a more detailed post later going into these categories.

* Founder Podcasts
* Technical Podcasts
* Marketing/Consulting Podcasts
* Political Podcasts
* San Diego Podcasts

What categories of podcasts do you listen to?
