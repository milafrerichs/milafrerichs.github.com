I am unfollowing a bunch of people and putting them into lists. 

If you're one of them, sorry about that, I still read you but in lists and when I'm ready for it.

I Need to reduce the daily amount of Tweets I see in my timeline and be more proactive about when I read what type of tweets. 

Thanks to James fee for the Inspiration. I already had a few lists but his suggestion really made sense :)

But it is not as straightforward as it could be. 

I would love a way to see all the people I follow that are not yet in a list. Then I could more easily put them in one. 

How are you consuming twitter these days?
