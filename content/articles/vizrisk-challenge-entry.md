I love playing Softball and I‘m playing for more than 10 years now, it is a great team sport and I love the mix of action, team play and personal challenge getting up 1 vs. 1 against the pitcher. I used to coach the women's team of the town that I studied in and was asked again to coach my team here in Berlin. I love coaching a team sport, strategizing how to approach the game and most important see players improve over time. 
Practice makes perfect and I love to practice and challenging myself to get better at something and to challenge the other players to get better and teach them what I learned over the years. 

This is one of the reasons why I want to challenge myself and will enter the _Viz Risk_ challenge from the Understanding Risk (UR) Community and GFDRR in partnership with Mapbox and the Data Visualization Society.

## Why? Practice makes perfect. :) 
I always wanted to enter a visualization challenge and this seems to be a perfect time and the right mix of Partners and datasets. 

Practicing my skills is an important part of working for yourself. I do it regularly, but I do not often share my results and my process in the public. I should be doing more of it and this is one of many efforts that I will be doing in the next couple of months. 

I recently had an interview with HOT (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap) and it made me think more about doing work for the humanitarian sector. Which is another reason why I will enter this challenge specifically. 

Furthermore, I had worked previously on a humanitarian project with GFDRR after the earthquake in Nepal to create a dashboard for all incoming data. And it was a great opportunity and I learned a lot during that time. 


## This will be definitely more challenging. 
I will probably enter the flooding challenge for Monrovia, Liberia. 
Coming up with a visualization for the burning question about flood prevention and potentially helping people with it is a huge burden and a huge motivator as well. 

I‘m looking forward to challenging myself and come up with different ways to visualize these important datasets. 

## Asking the right question
The challenge already provided a few questions I will use as a guiding factor throughout my process. But as always during a coz project and data analysis, the real questions will come up during the process. 
So while I will start with these questions they might not be the ones I will choose in the end. 
Here are the questions to start with:

**How can local government officials better understand, predict, prevent, and recover from flooding? **  
**What infrastructure is most vulnerable?**  
**Where might flood impacts be the most severe, or the most preventable?**

## Sharing progress and my process
During the time of the challenge (it‘s due on July 15th), I will not only share my progress working on it, but I will also share my process tackling this issue. 

Looking forward to working on this and sharing my progress here on the blog and on social media.
