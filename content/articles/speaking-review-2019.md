I love sharing what I know and love to go to conferences. (Read more bout this here). And sharing at a conference or giving a workshop is very satisfying. The feedback you get and the conversation you have afterwards are great. 

I wanted to write a quick review of lasts years conferences. 

I got accepted to speak at the following conferences in 2019

- FOSS4G NA, San Diego
- GoodTechFest, Chicago
- NACIS, Tacoma
- FOSS4G Oceania, Auckland

The three talks that I gave at these conferences were:
- Geospatial analysis pipeline with notebooks
- Letâ€˜s talk about maps
- Distraction free online maps
And I gave two workshops at FOSS4G NA and NACIS
Geospatial Data Visualization with d3

Unfortunately I needed to cancel my appearance for FOSS4G Oceania. I had some personal issues to take care of and could not afford to be away for a week and not travel around the world to Auckland. 
I felt bad for needing to cancel both my workshop and my accepted talk. 

Other conferences that I attended but did not speak:
- S-H-O-W conference


Conferences I want to speak this year, where I will submit to the CfP:

- FOSS4G, Calgary
- FOSS4G EU
- FOSS4G Oceania
- FOSS4G UK
- NACIS
