I love sharing what I know and love to go to conferences. (Read more bout this here). And sharing at a conference or giving a workshop is very satisfying. The feedback you get and the conversation you have afterward are great.

I wanted to write a quick review of lasts year's conferences.

I got accepted to speak at the following conferences in 2019

* FOSS4G NA, San Diego
* GoodTechFest, Chicago
* NACIS, Tacoma
* FOSS4G Oceania, Auckland

The three talks that I gave at these conferences were:

* [Rapid and repeatable Geospatial analysis with python and node using notebooks](https://civic.vision/f4gnan/)
* [Letâ€˜s talk about maps](https://civic.vision/gtf19/)
* Distraction-free online maps 

And I gave two workshops at FOSS4G NA and NACIS on [Geospatial Data Visualization with d3](https://course.mappingwithd3.com)

Unfortunately I needed to cancel my appearance for FOSS4G Oceania. I had some personal issues to take care of and could not afford to be away for a week and not travel around the world to Auckland.
I felt bad for needing to cancel both my workshop and my accepted talk.

Other conferences that I attended but did not speak:

* S-H-O-W conference

Conferences I want to speak this year, where I will submit to the CfP:

* FOSS4G, Calgary
* FOSS4G EU
* FOSS4G Oceania
* FOSS4G UK
* NACIS

What conferences are you planning to attend or even speak at?
