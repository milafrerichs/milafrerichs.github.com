+++
Habari HOT Team,

my Name is Mila and I help civic advocacy groups and nonprofits improve the life of citizens with the help of Open Data. I use the power of public open data and open source to build tools and visualization for civic advocacy groups and non-profits to increase transparency and accountability.

**I'm applying for the Data Communications and Visualization Specialist contract.**

# Motivation

I would love to help by using my skills to communicate the success of the Ramani Huria project to the worldbank and the world.

I want to use my skills to do good in the world and work almost exclusively with nonprofits, and this opportunity seems like a great way to apply my skills and help Tanzania.

I attended the FOSS4G in Dar last year and as part of the conference participated in a marine mapping workshop at the University of Zanzibar. The conference and especially the workshop were an excellent opportunity for me to get to know Zanzibaris and Tanzanians and I enjoyed talking to them and see their passion for HOT and mapping in general.

I love diving into data and creating reports and analysis from datasets. I volunteered with Code for America and Code for Germany because I’m especially interested in Civic Tech.

I worked professionally with nonprofits like the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and Code for America. Moreover, I have worked indirectly on a visualization dashboard for the Nepal Earthquakes.

I gave and will be offering workshops about “Geospatial data visualizations with d3” at geospatial conferences.

# Cover letter

I founded my company Civic Vision in 2014 and have been working with clients on geospatial data visualizations and visualizations in general.

I studied Geoinformatics at the University of Muenster, did not finish with a degree but instead founded my own company.

I give workshops at FOSS4G conference on „Geospatial Data Visualizations with d3“ and publish a weekly roundup of what‘s happening in civic tech and open data.

I was deeply involved in the Code for America and Code for Germany network, and still am connected, but do not participate as much as earlier.

I am passionate about HOT and mapping in general, I used missing maps a lot in the early days. I also worked professionally on mapping efforts during the Earthquake in Nepal and worked (professionally) on the Geonode project that a lot of humanitarian organizations use.

I mostly create data pipelines for project where it makes sense. This could either be a simple Makefile or a full-fledged pipeline with python and AWS Lambda.

In my previous consulting engagement I worked with a big agriculture company to improve their algorithms using satellite data. In this context we used a lot of Jupyter notebooks to test out theories and worked with numpy, rasterio and sentinel hub.
