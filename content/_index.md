# I help civic advocacy groups and governments improve the life of citizens with the help of Open Data.


Governmentes publish Open Data for everyone to use free of charge to increase transparency and help make better decisions with the availble data.  

Non-profits can use this treasure to keep the government accountable and improve the life of citizens. 

## I help non-profits find the right data and create __tools, dashboards and visulizations__ to increase their success.  

### Hi, I'm __Mila Frerichs.__

I love to help advocacy groups and non-profits make cities and the world a better place. That's why __I love what I do__ and would not exchange it for a regular job.

I use my software development skills to do good and help others. I am fortunate that I can use my __passion__ to make a living.  
I love what I do and if I would not have founded my own company [Civic Vision](https://civicvision.de) in 2014, I would volunteer my time to do good.

I like to give [talks](/talks) at (geospatial) conferences and share mostly stuff that I encounter in my work. I gave a lot of [workshops](/workshops) in d3 because that is my preferred library to create visualizations.

I live with my wife and our dog in a nice flat in the heart of __Berlin-West__.   
I was born in Berlin but moved to a small town MÃ¼nster where I studied Geoinformatics and met my wife. I played a lot of Softball during my university time and always worked on the side.

I'm [@milafrerichs](https://twitter.com/milafrerichs) on twitter and almost everywhere :) 

I write about Civic Tech, Open Data, mapping and vizualizations over at [Civic Open Data](http://civicopendata.com).
