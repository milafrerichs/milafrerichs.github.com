## Building Footprint Comparison

Very interesting comparison of building footprints from Microsoft and OpenStreetMap.

I recently used the Microsoft building footprint for my Zoning analysis in San Diego. And when I looked for building data I found that the Microsoft dataset was more complete than the Open Street Map data and if you look at the map it confirms it. And shows even more. very interesting, thanks for doing this.
