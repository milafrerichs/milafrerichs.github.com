How was your week? Mine was tumultuous. I got my Open Water Diver license, and I look forward to exploring the underwater world. But other than that a lot of stuff was going on.

What fun have you done the last week? Hit reply and share it with me.

# Geospatial Development

## Feature Comparison Mapping Libraries

I published a short feature comparison of popular mapping libraries. I looked at 13 features and compared them between 5 libraries that I consider the leading players: mapbox.js, OpenLayers, Leaflet, Google Maps, D3.

[You can check it out here](http://mappingwithd3.com/feature-comparison/?lsc=mf)

I will update this comparison over the next few days with more detailed descriptions.

Great use of images, small multiples and encoding the amount of access at the bottom of the images. Overall great project, and they did it all by hand. Worth checking out.
