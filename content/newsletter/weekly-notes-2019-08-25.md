# Geospatial Development

## Tool

Have you checked out: [http://projectionwizard.org](http://projectionwizard.org  "http://projectionwizard.org") yet?

It is a nice tool to select a good projection for the area of interest. 

And take a look at this tweet ;)

## Mercator

Another great look into the real size of Mercator. Still amazed that so many people on the web default to Mercator projections for their projects.

Here is another interactive version: [https://engaging-data.com/country-sizes-mercator/](https://engaging-data.com/country-sizes-mercator/ "https://engaging-data.com/country-sizes-mercator/")

## Precision and Size in GeoJSON

> It's wild how many GeoJSON files are in use with a coordinate precision of 10 or higher â€” I've seen file sizes cut in *half* just by hacking it down to 6 (RFC 7946 recommendation) + removing duplicate coords with zero change in visual correctness

From Ryan Murphy and I could not agree more. I shared another example a few weeks ago. We should all think about our usage of precision in our GeoJSON files, especially if they grow bigger in size.

# Data Visualization

## Color Guide

Great guide from the great people at Datawrapper. A must read resource and you should save it for future reference.

A little older from the week before but so good I need to share this. 

The use of annotation and text and still have an interactive is great!

## **Mapping the strain on our water**

I love maps that just show the data and some supporting things ( in this case rivers) that do not interfere too much with the data.

# Civic Tech

## Growth of  
Parking Infrastructure  
in Los Angeles

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_auto,dpr_auto,c_limit/milafrerichs.com/newsletter/data-viz/parking-la.png)

Not very beautiful to look at but crazy to see the amount of parking. They have a gif on their page showing the increase over decades.
