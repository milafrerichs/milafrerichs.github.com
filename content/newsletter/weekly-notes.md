## Tools & Frameworks for Mapping Data

After a discussion on twitter and a question I saw in a facebook group about what Tools are out there to create maps I thought I create a list of all the tools I could find. 

I created a new airtable and integrated it here. I also included the Tool/Framework is free to use or only paid. 

If you find a tool or framework that I missed please let me know I will add it to the list. 

# (Geospatial) Data Visualization

Another great week of geospatial data visualizations. 

## [What Micro-Mapping a City's Density Reveals]()

An interesting new look at density using satellite imagery and a different measure of density. By looking at a regular pattern of equally sized cells of one square kilometer you get a different perspective of cities. 

> _This perspective lets us drill down to the micro-geography of density in American cities, with oftentimes surprising results, as in the densest grid cell of greater Salt Lake City (below), which isn’t high-rises but mobile home parks._

This is a fascinating observation. I would have not guessed that a mobile home park would be more dense than a high-rise area. 

> _Just as average wealth and income statistics can’t take us very far in explaining how to fairly structure the distribution of economic gain in our society, the average population density of a vast metropolitan area does little to capture the many different ways that we might want to structure our cities and neighborhoods._

The whole article is well worth a read and the visualization is nice to play with.

## Subway Commute NYC

Nice visualization from the New York Times about your subway commute. I always love transportation visualizations. You can do so much with these datasets. 

The [data](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/archives.html) is Open Data from the M.T.A.

## [Atlas of the Moon]()

## [New Tool: **TheyDrawIt!: An Authoring Tool for Belief-Driven Visualization**]()

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_auto,dpr_auto,c_limit/milafrerichs.com/newsletter/data-viz/draw-it.gif)

This is great research and the tool looks promising. Still in the early phases and only works with linecharts and only GoogleSheets but still good progress. Would love to see more research into data viz recall.

> _We found that when users had the ability to draw their expectations and see them against the observed data, they **recalled the data 20–25% more accurately** a short time later._

## [Homeless and Urban Planning San Diego]()

The San Diego Data Library from Eric Busbom with Data Science for Non-Profits is starting a series of meetings exploring homelessness and urban planning. With Open Data datasets and data visualization they're going to look at the homeless population in San Diego.

# Civic Tech/Open Data

## Open Source procurement law in German state

The parliament in a German state has a new procurement law where Open Source solutions shall be given preference if it's technically possible and economically feasable. Whatever that means :)
[Law (if you can read Germany)](http://www.parldok.thueringen.de/ParlDok/dokument/71600/gesetz_zur_aenderung_des_thueringer_vergabegesetzes_und_anderer_haushaltsrechtlicher_vorschriften.pdf)
