How was your week? Mine was tumultuous. I got my Open Water Diver license, and I look forward to exploring the underwater world. But other than that a lot of stuff was going on.

What fun have you done the last week? Hit reply and share it with me.

## Feature Comparison Mapping Libraries

I published a short feature comparison of popular mapping libraries. I looked at 13 features and compared them between 5 libraries that I consider the leading players: mapbox.js, OpenLayers, Leaflet, Google Maps, D3.

[You can check it out here](http://mappingwithd3.com/feature-comparison/?lsc=mf)

I will update this comparison over the next few days with more detailed descriptions.
