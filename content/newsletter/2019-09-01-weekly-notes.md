# Geospatial Development

## FOSS4G (UK)

The global FOSS4G conference just ended on Friday and my twitter feed was full of it. Very interesting things, need to watch a few of those videos. I'm sad that I missed the global version of the conference this year. But I attended the North American version earlier this year, will attend the UK version later this month and likely head down to New Zealand for the Oceania version. 

## Mercator, again

A nice transition from just raw data to heat map and later to insight. (Thanks Josh for the nice summary üòÅ )

# Where can you afford to rent in California?

Nice interactive tool where you can put your salary and see where you could afford to live in California. For my upcoming course **Geospatial data visualization with d3** I'm using housing data for Chicago to map in a similar fashion. But I'm using neighborhoods as a measurement (because the data is provided in that fashion for the most part.)

# Short-term rentals in Toronto: UPGo city spotlight

The great thing about this report is not the small multiples (although I ‚ù§Ô∏è  small multiples). But rather that they published all their results on Github to be reproduced. Although the data is not available on GitHub just their analysis code.

## A night under the stars

Did I mention that I ‚ù§Ô∏è small multiples? This is a gorgeous example. 

And the first section is an explanation of how the charts work and how to read it. It's always recommended to include such a section if you have a novel way or choose a not standard way of showing data. 

## Color Tool

The great thing is the immediate feedback in a chart and a map. Although I would have used another chart than a pie.
