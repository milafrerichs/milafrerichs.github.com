How was your week? Mine was tumultuous. I got my Open Water Diver license, and I look forward to exploring the underwater world. But other than that a lot of stuff was going on.

What fun have you done the last week? Hit reply and share it with me.

# Geospatial Development

## Geospatial Data Visualization with d3

Over the last couple of months, I'm preparing an online video course on creating maps with d3. I now have a more detailed landingpage and finally a domain. I've been working on a free lesson which I will be releasing soon (get on the waiting list to be the first to know). And for that free lesson, I was working on a tool/platform to make it easy and interactive. You can read more about it if you scroll to the end of this email.

## Feature Comparison Mapping Libraries

I published a short feature comparison of popular mapping libraries. I looked at 13 features and compared them between 5 libraries that I consider the leading players: mapbox.js, OpenLayers, Leaflet, Google Maps, D3.

[You can check it out here](http://mappingwithd3.com/feature-comparison/?lsc=mf)

I will update this comparison over the next few days with more detailed descriptions.

# Data Visualization

## How the UK transformed electricity supply

Have you seen the interactive of CarbonBrief?

It is really well done, and the colors are great. I especially liked that they included their methodology at the end of the interactive. Everyone should do it.

## Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot

Really lovely visuals about Zoning in the US, especially Single Family home zoning and how it differs between cities.

I want to do something similar for San Diego. Are you missing a city that you would like to see analyzed in that manner? Hit Reply. And I try to take a look if itâ€˜s possible.

# Civic Tech

The CityLab Berlin launched a couple of weeks ago. It is modeled a little bit after the Civic Hall in New York (https://civichall.org). Looking forward to the events and direction they will take.

# Business/Consulting

As I mentioned above, I'm currently working on the launch of my video course on d3. For that, I built a small tool that makes it easier to show tutorial content (Markdown, HTML), a code editor, and the result of that code. It is similar to CodeSandbox and other online code editors, but it adds the ability to show explanations and solutions for your tutorial/exercise.

# Tip of the week

Always be shipping. It felt really good shipping small things the past few weeks. You feel better, even if it is not 100%. I fall into the trap as well, so many times. But I try to improve and always be shipping.
