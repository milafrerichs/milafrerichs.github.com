# Geospatial Development

## [Stop Using Zip Codes for Geospatial Analysis](https://carto.com/blog/zip-codes-spatial-analysis/)

Great article by Carto explaining where Zip codes originate, why they're not useful for geospatial analysis and what you should use instead.

The problem with zip codes are:

> They don't represent real boundaries, but rather routes
>
> They don't represent how humans behave

Read the [full article](https://carto.com/blog/zip-codes-spatial-analysis/), it's well worth it.

## Urban Heat Vulnerability Map of Vienna

Literal heat map of the city of Vienna. 

There is also a methodology [PDF](https://www.wien.gv.at/stadtentwicklung/energie/pdf/hitzekarte-methode.pdf) which explains the methodology very detailed. They used satellite data to calculate the average yearly temperature. Very interesting, I thought about something similar as well. I might actual do one of those for San Diego and Berlin sometime soon.

Do you need a Bubble map? Do you have a geojson? Look no further than this great notebook from the LA Times data desk on Observable. 

# Data Visualization

## [Where the last pristine skies in America are](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/06/where-last-pristine-skies-america-are/)

Light pollution is something everyone kind of knows but we're not really aware of it. We're used to how the sky looks like in the city. But man are we missing out. Look at the gorgeous photos in this article and find the place were you can see the real sky. 

## [Risk of Sunburn Across the U.S.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145413/new-map-shows-risk-of-sunburn-across-the-us)

We all know it and I'm guilty as well of not using sun blocker all the time. The Earth Observatory from NASA published a great gif of maps showing the risk of sunburn across the U.S.

And in my favorite American City, San Diego the risk is there throughout the year :) Great and not so great for someone like me who does not use sun blocker that often.

> After just 10 weeks in government, the Coding It Forward fellows were able to succinctly identify the promise and challenges in getting young people to join the government.

# Business/Consulting

I used the weekend to work on my monthly and weekly planning. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=ae698dfc15534740ba1f3db7a89dff7b) is a great tool for organizing your business. I use it for all my documents and ideas that I have. For my weekly planning. Just not yet for my daily tasks. It's just not there yet, their apps are not at the level I want for a task manager. But for organizing all my other business stuff I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=ae698dfc15534740ba1f3db7a89dff7b). Be sure to check it [out](https://www.notion.so/?r=ae698dfc15534740ba1f3db7a89dff7b). (Affiliate Link, you get 10$ credit for a plan).
