In hindsight I had a productive week. I published two new content items the last week. 

## [Single Family Zoning San Diego](http://milafrerichs.de/articles/zoning-san-diego)

Last week I shared an article from The NY Times about zoning in American cities. And I was thinking about doing the same analysis for San Diego. And I did. You can read more about it [here]().

# (Geospatial) Data Visualization

A lot of interesting maps were floating around the last week. Here are a couple of my favorites:

## Power Plants in Europe

This is a great take on power plants in Europe. I did a similar one just for Germany. This reminded me to update the data on my visualization and share it. 

## [Mapping diversity](https://www.axios.com/where-americas-diversity-is-increasing-the-fastest-ae06eea7-e031-46a2-bb64-c74de85eca77.html)

Alberto Cairo had an interesting take on that visualization. You can read it here: [Mapping diversity and taking probability and base rates into account](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2019/07/mapping-diversity-and-taking.html)

## [Visualizing unreported murders in Mexico](https://zonas-de-silencio.eluniversal.com.mx)

> El Universal, in collaboration with Google News Lab, has just launched a project that analyzes unreported murders in Mexico, those cases that don't get covered in the news

I‘m not a huge fan of 3D maps. But I like that people try to experiment with different map types.

# Civic Tech/Open Data

## [IOP Publishing begins open data trial](https://www.miragenews.com/iop-publishing-begins-open-data-trial/)

This is a great initiative and everyone should adopt such a policy: 

> The policy requires authors to include a data availability statement with their article, indicating whether data is accessible and, if so, where it can be found and under what licensing terms. The policy also strongly encourages authors to share their data.


## [FDA supports open data to improve patient safety](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/fda-supports-open-data-to-improve-patient-safety.html)

> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed a letter of support May 30 for openly sharing data through efforts such as the Patient Safety Movement Foundation's Open Data Pledge, according to an announcement made June 27.

## [Cities lead the way on open source tools for mobility](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/cities-lead-the-way-on-open-source-tools-for-mobility-4314)

# Business/Consulting

I will be giving two more workshop at geospatial conferences. It will be the same as my previous and will largely be influenced by the online workshop I’m currently creating.
