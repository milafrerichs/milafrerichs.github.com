Last weekend I had another session in the pool on my way of getting the Open Water Diver certificate. This is really fun and I'm looking forward exploring the Oceans.

On the weekend I wanted to create something small. I wanted to create something that I might want to use for my workshops. After trying out if it would work as I would expected and it did, I started looking into javascript frameworks. I wanted to learn a new one anyway and I wanted to find one where I could get something done quickly. After a bit of research and watching a few talks on youtube about these frameworks I settled on Svelte. It was quite easy to get started and I like the concept of it. Will try to write a more detailed post later.

Need to come up with a good name though :)

# Data Visualization

I [published](http://milafrerichs.de/articles/vizrisk-challenge-audience?lsc=mf) a new post on my blog about the VizRisk challenge I'm participating in. It's about what audience I choose and what questions you come along when you're trying to choose an audience.

# Tip of the week

This happened to me last week: I tried to find a way to get a library to work as I thought it should. Spent almost the whole day on. In the end I looked at another library and it did what I wanted and was smaller and better maintained. So my tip for this week: Choose another library quicker if the one youâ€™re using does not get you were you want.
