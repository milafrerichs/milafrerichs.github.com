For the agriculture giant __Yara__ I helped develop an app for farmers.
In a team of 3-6 people, I was responsible for the __geospatial aspect__ of the project. Creating an __interactive map__ with the ability to create fields and create application maps. Furthermore was I responsible to improve the algorithm for creating automatic application maps from satellite imagery.
