The Travel Safety startup __GeoSure__ wanted to find new revenue models for their travel data and reached out to me to help them. I build an __interactive online map__ to showcase their collected data on Travel Safety around the globe.  Furthermore, I created the _API and a TileServer_ for distributing and selling their data.
