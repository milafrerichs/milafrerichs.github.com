Vision Zero is a topic more and more cities are taking seriously. The challenge is to communicate the severiety of the problem. 

With this project I tried to start with a human connection.  
I wanted to show where the accident happened.

## Inspiration

The city of Los Angeles had a map available on their vision zero website that took the human connection to an extreme. They showed traffic fatalities on the map but added who had died there. The age of the person, the gender, the race and if available an image.  
That was really powerful.  
I would have liked to do the same but as almost always the available data was the constraining factor.  


Situation, Complication, Question and answer
