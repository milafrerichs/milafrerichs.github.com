Following the Mw 7.8 earthquake in Nepal, the World Bank Nepal response team has been collecting and curating spatial data useful for damage assessments and recovery planning generated by the International community. I worked for the __GFDRR__ team to create a __geospatial dashboard__ aggregating and showing these datasets.
