While working on another project for the OKF (Open Knowledge Foundation Germany) we came across a arms export map from the BICC. We wanted to include the visualization and reached out to them. We offered to remake the visualization to improve its __readability__ and make it _embeddable_. They agreed, and I worked on this new geospatial visualization.
