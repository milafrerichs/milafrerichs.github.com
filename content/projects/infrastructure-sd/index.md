For the __Community Planning Groups of San Diego__, I developed a
	dashboard and supporting tools to increase __transparency in the planning process__.
	The collaboration included the _local civic tech community_, members of the _Community
	Planning Groups_ and the office of _Councilmember Mark Kersey_.
