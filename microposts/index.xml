      <description>I started implementing profit first at the beginning of the year, after I listened to the Audio book.
The book got recommended by a bunch of people and I knew I wanted to get better at handling my business finances so I thought I try it out.
The book was really great and there is so much truth in the way he explains the mindset most entrepreneurs have.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t look at your balance sheet to make spending decisions you might want to try out this model.</description>

      <description>I want to publish more, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have it go out to the void of twitter.
I found this neat idea from Justin Miller of Micro.blogs/microposts.
And I will try this out. Short thoughts or ideas that would normally go to twitter or nowhere will live here.</description>
