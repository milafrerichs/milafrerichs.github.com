<p>Instead of goals I adapted an approach by Brian Casel using <a href="https://briancasel.com/themes-not-goals/">themes</a>.</p>

<p>I think this is more aligned with my thinking and lifestyle.Here are my themes as of February 2019.</p>

<h2 id="travel-to-at-least-two-new-cities-regions">Travel to at least two new cities/regions</h2>

<p>I want to explore more of the world.</p>

<p>Last year I managed to visit 4 continents. Only one is left: Antartica</p>

<p>This can be challenging but I want to make it someday.</p>

<p>Take my wife with me on conferences. She should get more from my travels. Will be hard for our dog but maybe instead of doing two weeks of conference I just do one and take my wife with me.</p>

<h2 id="work-more-with-nonprofit-clients">Work more with nonprofit clients</h2>

<p>Last year I mostly worked with for profit clients. Which is totally fine and allowed me to add more to the bottom line.</p>

<h2 id="publish-more-stuff-twitter-linkedin-and-blog-newsletter">Publish more stuff (Twitter, LinkedIn and blog/newsletter</h2>

<p>I want to be more proactive sharing stuff that I did. And share insights from my work day. I will probably start a work journal that I update weekly or bi-weekly.</p>
